###Run Instructions

1. Download the project to the computer using either
```git clone git@github.com:usc-csci201-fall2013/team18.git``` or 
https://github.com/usc-csci201-fall2013/team18/archive/master.zip

2. In the Eclipse IDE, create a new java project.
Remember to include JRE System Library (JavaSE-1.7), and JUnit 4 Library

3. Import "source" folder into the project. Right click the "source" folder.
In "Bulid Path", choose "Use as a Source Folder"

4. Choose MainGui.java under source/gui. Click "Run as..." and choose
